# hello-world
My first repository

Hey, to whomever is reading this i'm currently writing this description of myself sat in the middle seat of a plane on my way back from a holiday in Dubai with my parents sat to the left of me and my friend sat to the right. I would describe my self as a bit of a daredevil, mainly because my bucket list is full of stuff my mother would describe as crazy (e.g. Bunjee Jumping). I have already started crossing items off this list with my skydiving over the palm and completing the longest urban zipline off a building on the holiday mentioned earlier. Apart from being a daredevil I would also definitely say that I am a geek, as I love experimenting with computers with using them to solve problems and increase convience in doing tasks. At home this has sprialled into converting a spare bedroom into a server room with a 12U cabinet full of servers, storage and network equipment that basically runs the entire house. For the more social aspect of my life I would descrine myself as up for almost anything and can talk about most things as long as it isn't sport.
